## Getting started

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Why should I use OpenRouter?">
        OpenRouter provides a unified API to access all the major LLM models on the
        market. It also allows users to aggregate their billing in one place and
        keep track of all of their usage using our analytics.

        OpenRouter passes through the pricing of the underlying providers, while pooling their uptime,
        so you get the same pricing you'd get from the provider directly, with a
        unified API and fallbacks so that you get much better uptime.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I get started with OpenRouter?">
        To get started, create an account and add credits on the
        [Credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits) page. Credits are simply
        deposits on OpenRouter that you use for LLM inference.
        When you use the API or chat interface, we deduct the request cost from your
        credits. Each model and provider has a different price per million tokens.

        Once you have credits you can either use the chat room, or create API keys
        and start using the API. You can read our [quickstart](/docs/quickstart)
        guide for code samples and more.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I get support?">
        The best way to get support is to join our
        [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW) and ping us in the #help forum.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I get billed for my usage on OpenRouter?">
        For each model we have the pricing displayed per million tokens. There is
        usually a different price for prompt and completion tokens. There are also
        models that charge per request, for images and for reasoning tokens. All of
        these details will be visible on the models page.

        When you make a request to OpenRouter, we receive the total number of tokens processed
        by the provider. We then calculate the corresponding cost and deduct it from your credits.
        You can review your complete usage history in the [Activity tab](https://openrouter.ai/activity).

        You can also add the `usage: {include: true}` parameter to your chat request
        to get the usage information in the response.

        We pass through the pricing of the underlying providers; there is no markup
        on inference pricing (however we do charge a [fee](/docs/faq#pricing-and-fees) when purchasing credits).
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing and Fees

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What are the fees for using OpenRouter?">
        OpenRouter charges a {getTotalFeeString('stripe')} fee when you purchase credits. We pass through
        the pricing of the underlying model providers without any markup, so you pay
        the same rate as you would directly with the provider.

        Crypto payments are charged a fee of {getTotalFeeString('coinbase')}.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Is there a fee for using my own provider keys (BYOK)?">
        Yes, if you choose to use your own provider API keys (Bring Your Own Key -
        BYOK), there is a fee of{' '}
        {bn(openRouterBYOKFee.fraction).times(100).toString()}% of what the same
        model and provider would normally cost on OpenRouter. This fee is deducted
        from your OpenRouter credits. This allows you to manage your rate limits and
        costs directly with the provider while still leveraging OpenRouter's unified
        interface.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Models and Providers

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What LLM models does OpenRouter support?">
        OpenRouter provides access to a wide variety of LLM models, including frontier models from major AI labs.
        For a complete list of models you can visit the [models browser](https://openrouter.ai/models) or fetch the list
        through the [models api](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How frequently are new models added?">
        We work on adding models as quickly as we can. We often have partnerships with
        the labs releasing models and can release models as soon as they are
        available. If there is a model missing that you'd like OpenRouter to support, feel free to message us on
        [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What are model variants?">
        Variants are suffixes that can be added to the model slug to change its behavior.

        Static variants can only be used with specific models and these are listed in our [models
        api](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models).

        1. `:free` - The model is always provided for free and has low rate limits.
        2. `:beta` - The model is not moderated by OpenRouter.
        3. `:extended` - The model has longer than usual context length.
        4. `:thinking` - The model supports reasoning by default.

        Dynamic variants can be used on all models and they change the behavior of how the request is routed or used.

        1. `:online` - All requests will run a query to extract web results that are attached to the prompt.
        2. `:nitro` - Providers will be sorted by throughput rather than the default sort, optimizing for faster
        response times.
        3. `:floor` - Providers will be sorted by price rather than the default sort, prioritizing the most
        cost-effective options.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I am an inference provider, how can I get listed on OpenRouter?">
        You can read our requirements at the [Providers
        page](/docs/use-cases/for-providers). If you would like to contact us, the best
        place to reach us is over email.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is the expected latency/response time for different models?">
        For each model on OpenRouter we show the latency (time to first token) and the token
        throughput for all providers. You can use this to estimate how long requests
        will take. If you would like to optimize for throughput you can use the
        `:nitro` variant to route to the fastest provider.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How does model fallback work if a provider is unavailable?">
        If a provider returns an error OpenRouter will automatically fall back to the
        next provider. This happens transparently to the user and allows production
        apps to be much more resilient. OpenRouter has a lot of options to configure
        the provider routing behavior. The full documentation can be found [here](/docs/features/provider-routing).
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API Technical Specifications

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What authentication methods are supported?">
        OpenRouter uses three authentication methods:

        1. Cookie-based authentication for the web interface and chatroom
        2. API keys (passed as Bearer tokens) for accessing the completions API and other core endpoints
        3. [Provisioning API keys](/docs/features/provisioning-api-keys) for programmatically managing API keys through
        the key management endpoints
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How are rate limits calculated?">
        For free models, rate limits are determined by the credits that you have purchased.
        If you have purchased at least {FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD} credits, your free model rate limit will
        be {FREE_MODEL_HAS_CREDITS_RPD} requests per day.
        Otherwise, you will be rate limited to {FREE_MODEL_NO_CREDITS_RPD} free model API requests per day.

        You can learn more about how rate limits work for paid accounts in our [rate limits
        documentation](/docs/api-reference/limits).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What API endpoints are available?">
        OpenRouter implements the OpenAI API specification for /completions and
        /chat/completions endpoints, allowing you to use any model with the same
        request/response format. Additional endpoints like /api/v1/models are also
        available. See our [API documentation](/docs/api-reference/overview) for
        detailed specifications.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What are the supported formats?">
        The API supports text and images.
        [Images](/docs/api-reference/overview#images--multimodal) can be passed as
        URLs or base64 encoded images. PDF and other file types are coming soon.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How does streaming work?">
        Streaming uses server-sent events (SSE) for real-time token delivery. Set
        `stream: true` in your request to enable streaming responses.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What SDK support is available?">
        OpenRouter is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI. Therefore, any SDKs that
        support OpenAI by default also support OpenRouter. Check out our
        [docs](/docs/community/open-ai-sdk) for more details.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy and Data Logging

Please see our [Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy).

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What data is logged during API use?">
        We log basic request metadata (timestamps, model used, token counts). Prompt
        and completion are not logged by default. We do zero logging of your prompts/completions,
        even if an error occurs, unless you opt-in to logging them.

        We have an opt-in [setting](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy) that
        lets users opt-in to log their prompts and completions in exchange for a 1%
        discount on usage costs.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What data is logged during Chatroom use?">
        The same data privacy applies to the chatroom as the API. All conversations
        in the chatroom are stored locally on your device. Conversations will not sync across devices.
        It is possible to export and import conversations using the settings menu in the chatroom.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What third-party sharing occurs?">
        OpenRouter is a proxy that sends your requests to the model provider for it to be completed.
        We work with all providers to, when possible, ensure that prompts and completions are not logged or used for
        training.
        Providers that do log, or where we have been unable to confirm their policy, will not be routed to unless the
        model training
        toggle is switched on in the [privacy settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy) tab.

        If you specify [provider routing](/docs/features/provider-routing) in your request, but none of the providers
        match the level of privacy specified in your account settings, you will get an error and your request will not
        complete.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Credit and Billing Systems

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What purchase options exist?">
        OpenRouter uses a credit system where the base currency is US dollars. All
        of the pricing on our site and API is denoted in dollars. Users can top up
        their balance manually or set up auto top up so that the balance is
        replenished when it gets below the set threshold.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Do credits expire?">
        Per our [terms](https://openrouter.ai/terms), we reserve the right to expire
        unused credits after one year of purchase.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="My credits haven't showed up in my account">
        If you paid using Stripe, sometimes there is an issue with the Stripe
        integration and credits can get delayed in showing up on your account. Please allow up to one hour.
        If your credits still have not appeared after an hour, contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW)
        and we will
        look into it.

        If you paid using crypto, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW)
        and we will look into it.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What's the refund policy?">
        Refunds for unused Credits may be requested within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the transaction was
        processed. If no refund request is received within twenty-four (24) hours following the purchase, any unused
        Credits become non-refundable. To request a refund within the eligible period, you can use the refund button on
        the [Credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits) page. The unused credit amount will be refunded to your
        payment method; the platform fees are non-refundable. Note that cryptocurrency payments are never refundable.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How to monitor credit usage?">
        The [Activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity) page allows users to view
        their historic usage and filter the usage by model, provider and api key.

        We also provide a [credits api](/docs/api-reference/get-credits) that has
        live information about the balance and remaining credits for the account.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What free tier options exist?">
        All new users receive a very small free allowance to be able to test out OpenRouter.
        There are many [free models](https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0) available
        on OpenRouter, it is important to note that these models have low rate limits
        ({FREE_MODEL_NO_CREDITS_RPD} requests per day total)
        and are usually not suitable for production use. If you have purchased at
        least {FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD} credits,
        the free models will be limited to {FREE_MODEL_HAS_CREDITS_RPD} requests per day.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do volume discounts work?">
        OpenRouter does not currently offer volume discounts, but you can reach out to us
        over email if you think you have an exceptional use case.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What payment methods are accepted?">
        We accept all major credit cards, AliPay and cryptocurrency payments in
        USDC. We are working on integrating PayPal soon, if there are any payment
        methods that you would like us to support please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How does OpenRouter make money?">
        We charge a small [fee](/docs/faq#pricing-and-fees) when purchasing credits. We never mark-up the pricing
        of the underlying providers, and you'll always pay the same as the provider's
        listed price.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Account Management

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How can I delete my account?">
        Go to the [Settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/preferences) page and click Manage Account.
        In the modal that opens, select the Security tab. You'll find an option there to delete your account.

        Note that unused credits will be lost and cannot be reclaimed if you delete and later recreate your account.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How does team access work?">
        Team management is coming very soon! For now you can use [provisioning API
        keys](/docs/features/provisioning-api-keys) to allow sharing credits with
        people on your team.
