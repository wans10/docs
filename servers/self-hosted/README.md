# Fern Self-Hosting

This repo contains a Dockerfile for self-hosting Fern's docs product. This project is a TypeScript monorepo that uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). We've created a Dockerfile that can be used for self-hosting.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

- Make sure Node.js 18+ and pnpm are installed on your machine
- Have Docker installed and have the daemon open on your machine

## Building the Docker Image:

To build the image from this directory:

1. execute the bash script from your terminal `sh create_self_hosted_docker.sh`
2. run the resulting image in a container `docker run fern-self-hosted:latest`

To enter a shell inside the container:

1. use the variable `RUN_MODE=shell` like follows `docker run -it -e RUN_MODE=shell fern-self-hosted`

To expose MinIO ports to your host machine:

1. `docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -p 8080:8080 -it -e RUN_MODE=shell fern-self-hosted:latest`
2. Visit http://localhost:9001/
3. Should see MinIO Web UI. Can login with user/password (minioadmin, minioadmin)

To query postgres:

When the Docker container is built, FDR’s database migrations are automatically applied to the local Postgres instance. If you want to inspect the tables or data in your local Postgres database running inside the self-hosted Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Open a shell inside the Docker container (see instructions above)
2. Connect to Postgres using psql: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres`
3. Switch to the FDR database: `\c fdr`
4. Once connected, you can list the tables with `\dt` and you should see all the expected tables in the FDR database.

## Testing

To run the test suite from this directory:
`pnpm test:self-hosted`

## Recommended Developer Workflow

Rebuilding the docker container is slow and if you were to rebuild the container every time you made changes to any code in the fern-platform repo it would slow you down. To iterate quickly you should use the following workfow.

### Workflow to run everything:

```
cd /fern-platform
Run pnpm docs:self-hosted-bundle:build
Run pnpm --filter=@fern-platform/self-hosted docker:build

Run pnpm --filter=@fern-platform/self-hosted docker:run
```

Finally navigate to http://localhost:3000/ where you should see your docs

### To test changes to NextApp:

Run this outside your docker:
`pnpm docs:self-hosted-bundle:build
`

Inside your docker run the restart script:

```
cd /app/fern-platform/servers/self-hosted/scripts
sh restart_next_app.sh
```

### To test changes to FDR:

Run this outside your docker: `pnpm docs:self-hosted-fdr:compile`

Inside your docker run the restart script:

```
cd /app/fern-platform/servers/self-hosted/scripts
sh restart_fdr_server.sh
```

### Known Issues

You may need to do the following in your repo outside the docker container as we've seen some weird caching issues:

```
pnpm clean
pnpm compile
```
