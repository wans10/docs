# Fern Self-Hosting

This repo contains a Dockerfile for self-hosting Fern's docs product. This project is a TypeScript monorepo that uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). We've created a Dockerfile that can be used for self-hosting.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

- Make sure Node.js 18+ and pnpm are installed on your machine
- Have Docker installed and have the daemon open on your machine

## Building the Docker Image:

To build the image from this directory:

1. execute the bash script from your terminal `sh create_self_hosted_docker.sh`
2. run the resulting image in a container `docker run fern-self-hosted:latest`

To enter a shell inside the container:

1. use the variable `RUN_MODE=shell` like follows `docker run -it -e RUN_MODE=shell fern-self-hosted`

To expose MinIO ports to your host machine:

1. `docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -p 8080:8080 -it -e RUN_MODE=shell fern-self-hosted:latest`
2. Visit http://localhost:9001/
3. Should see MinIO Web UI. Can login with user/password (minioadmin, minioadmin)

To query postgres:

When the Docker container is built, FDRâ€™s database migrations are automatically applied to the local Postgres instance. If you want to inspect the tables or data in your local Postgres database running inside the self-hosted Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Open a shell inside the Docker container (see instructions above)
2. Connect to Postgres using psql: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres`
3. Switch to the FDR database: `\c fdr`
4. Once connected, you can list the tables with `\dt` and you should see all the expected tables in the FDR database.

## Testing

To run the test suite from this directory:
`pnpm test:self-hosted`

## Recommended Developer Workflow

Rebuilding the docker container is slow and if you were to rebuild the container every time you made changes to any code in the fern-platform repo it would slow you down. To iterate quickly you should use the following workfow.

### Workflow to run everything:

```
cd /fern-platform
Run pnpm docs:self-hosted-bundle:build
Run pnpm --filter=@fern-platform/self-hosted docker:build

Run pnpm --filter=@fern-platform/self-hosted docker:run
```

Finally navigate to http://localhost:3000/ where you should see your docs

### To test changes to NextApp:

Run this outside your docker:
`pnpm docs:self-hosted-bundle:build
`

Inside your docker run the restart script:

```
cd /app/fern-platform/servers/self-hosted/scripts
sh restart_next_app.sh
```

### To test changes to FDR:

Run this outside your docker: `pnpm docs:self-hosted-fdr:compile`

Inside your docker run the restart script:

```
cd /app/fern-platform/servers/self-hosted/scripts
sh restart_fdr_server.sh
```

### Known Issues

You may need to do the following in your repo outside the docker container as we've seen some weird caching issues:

```
pnpm clean
pnpm compile
```
