<Tip>
  Making additional accounts or API keys will not affect your rate limits, as we
  govern capacity globally. We do however have different rate limits for
  different models, so you can share the load that way if you do run into
  issues.

## Rate Limits and Credits Remaining

To check the rate limit or credits left on an API key, make a GET request to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/key`.

<Template data={{ API_KEY_REF }}>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript"
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/key', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}',
    },
    });
    ```

    ```python title="Python"
    import requests
    import json

    response = requests.get(
    url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/key",
    headers={
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}"
    }
    )

    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

If you submit a valid API key, you should get a response of the form:

```typescript TypeScript
type Key = {
  data: {
    label: string;
    usage: number; // Number of credits used
    limit: number | null; // Credit limit for the key, or null if unlimited
    is_free_tier: boolean; // Whether the user has paid for credits before
    // rate_limit: { ... } // A deprecated object in the response, safe to ignore
  };
};
```

There are a few rate limits that apply to certain types of requests, regardless of account status:

1. Free usage limits: If you're using a free model variant (with an ID ending in <code>
   sepVariant.Free</code>

   ), you can make up to FREE_MODEL_RATE_LIMIT_RPM requests per minute. The following per-day limits apply:

- If you have purchased less than FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD credits, you're limited to FREE_MODEL_NO_CREDITS_RPD <code>
  sepVariant.Free</code>

   model requests per day.
- If you purchase at least FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD credits, your daily limit is increased to FREE_MODEL_HAS_CREDITS_RPD <code>
  sepVariant.Free</code>

   model requests per day.

2. **DDoS protection**: Cloudflare's DDoS protection will block requests that dramatically exceed reasonable usage.

If your account has a negative credit balance, you may see <code>
HTTPStatus.S402_Payment_Required</code>

 errors, including for free models. Adding credits to put your balance above zero allows you to use those models again.
